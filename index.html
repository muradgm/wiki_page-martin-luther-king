												<h2>Who Was Martin Luther King Jr?</h2>
												<p>
													Martin Luther King Jr. was a Baptist minister and
													civil-rights activist who had a seismic impact on race
													relations in the United States, beginning in the
													mid-1950s.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													Among his many efforts, King headed the Southern
													Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Through his
													activism and inspirational speeches, he played a
													pivotal role in ending the legal segregation of
													African American citizens in the United States, as
													well as the creation of the

														onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);"

														>Voting Rights Act</a
													>of 1965.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													King won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, among several
													other honors. He continues to be remembered as one of
													the most influential and inspirational African
													American leaders in history.

												<h2>Early Life</h2>
												<p>
													Born as Michael King Jr. on January 15, 1929, Martin
													Luther King Jr. was the middle child of Michael King
													Sr. and Alberta Williams King.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													The King and Williams families had roots in rural
													Georgia. Martin Jr.'s grandfather, A.D. Williams, was
													a rural minister for years and then moved to Atlanta
													in 1893.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													He took over the small, struggling Ebenezer Baptist
													church with around 13 members and made it into a
													forceful congregation. He married Jennie Celeste Parks
													and they had one child that survived, Alberta.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													Martin Sr. came from a&nbsp;family
													of&nbsp;sharecroppers in a poor farming community. He
													married Alberta in 1926 after an eight-year courtship.
													The newlyweds moved to A.D.'s home in Atlanta.
												</p>
												<p>
													Martin Sr. stepped in as pastor of Ebenezer Baptist
													Church upon the death of his father-in-law in 1931. He
													too became a successful minister and adopted the name
													Martin Luther King Sr. in honor of the German
													Protestant religious leader
													<a
														href="https://www.biography.com/religious-figure/martin-luther"
														>Martin Luther</a
													>. In due time, Michael Jr. would follow his father's
													lead and adopt the name himself.
												</p>
												<p>
													<a
														href="https://www.biography.com/news/martin-luther-king-jr-martin-luther-similarities"
														>READ MORE: Martin Luther King Jr. and Martin
														Luther: The Parallels Between the Two Leaders</a
													>
												</p>
												<p>
													King had an older sister, Willie Christine, and a
													younger brother, Alfred Daniel Williams King. The King
													children grew up in a secure and loving environment.
													Martin Sr. was more the disciplinarian, while his
													wife's gentleness easily balanced out the father's
													strict hand.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													Though they undoubtedly tried, King’s parents couldn’t
													shield him completely from racism. Martin Sr. fought
													against racial prejudice, not just because his race
													suffered, but because he considered racism and
													segregation to be an affront to God's will. He
													strongly discouraged any sense of class superiority in
													his children which left a lasting impression on Martin
													Jr.
												</p>
												<p>
													Growing up in Atlanta, Georgia, King entered public
													school at age five. In May&nbsp;1936 he was baptized,
													but the event made little impression on him.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													In May&nbsp;1941, King was 12 years old when his
													grandmother, Jennie, died of a heart attack. The event
													was traumatic for King, more so because he was out
													watching a parade against his parents' wishes when she
													died. Distraught at the news, young King jumped from a
													second-story window at the family home, allegedly
													attempting suicide.
												</p>
												<p>
													King attended
													<a
														href="https://www.biography.com/activist/booker-t-washington"
														>Booker T. Washington</a
													>
													High School, where he was said to be a precocious
													student. He skipped both the ninth and eleventh
													grades, and entered Morehouse College in Atlanta at
													age 15, in 1944. He was a popular student, especially
													with his female classmates, but an unmotivated student
													who floated through his first two years.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													Although his family was deeply involved in the church
													and worship, King questioned religion in general and
													felt uncomfortable with overly emotional displays of
													religious worship. This discomfort continued through
													much of his adolescence, initially leading him to
													decide against entering the ministry, much to his
													father's dismay.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													But in his junior year, King took a Bible class,
													renewed his faith and began to envision a career in
													the ministry. In the fall of his senior year, he told
													his father of his decision.
												</p>

												<h2>Education and Spiritual Growth</h2>
												<p>
													In 1948, King earned a sociology degree from
													<a
														href="https://www.morehouse.edu/"
														rel="nofollow noopener"
														onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);"
														target="_blank"
														>Morehouse College</a
													>
													and attended the liberal Crozer Theological Seminary
													in Chester, Pennsylvania. He thrived in all his
													studies, and was valedictorian of his class in 1951,
													and elected student body president. He also earned a
													fellowship for graduate study.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													But King also rebelled against his father’s more
													conservative influence by drinking beer and playing
													pool while at college. He became involved with a white
													woman and went through a difficult time before he
													could break off the affair.
												</p>
												<p>
													During his last year in seminary, King came under the
													guidance of Morehouse College President Benjamin E.
													Mays who influenced King’s spiritual development. Mays
													was an outspoken advocate for racial equality and
													encouraged King to view Christianity as a potential
													force for social change. After being accepted at
													several colleges for his doctoral study, King enrolled
													at Boston University.
												</p>
												<p>
													During the work on his doctorate, King met
													<a
														href="https://www.biography.com/activist/coretta-scott-king"
														>Coretta Scott</a
													>, an aspiring singer and musician at the New England
													Conservatory school in Boston. They were married in
													June 1953 and had four children, Yolanda, Martin
													Luther King III, Dexter Scott and
													<a
														href="https://www.biography.com/activist/bernice-king"
														>Bernice</a
													>.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													In 1954, while still working on his dissertation, King
													became pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church of
													Montgomery, Alabama. He completed his Ph.D. and earned
													his degree in 1955. King was only 25 years old.
												</p>
												<h2>Montgomery Bus Boycott</h2>
												<p>
													On March 2, 1955, a 15-year-old girl refused to give
													up her seat to a white man on a Montgomery city bus in
													violation of local law. Teenager Claudette Colvin was
													then arrested and taken to jail.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													At first, the local chapter of the
													<a
														href="https://www.history.com/topics/civil-rights-movement/naacp"
														rel="nofollow noopener"
														onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);"
														target="_blank"
														>NAACP</a
													>
													felt they had an excellent test case to challenge
													Montgomery's segregated bus policy. But then it was
													revealed that Colvin was pregnant and civil rights
													leaders feared this would scandalize the deeply
													religious Black community and make Colvin (and, thus
													the group's efforts) less credible in the eyes of
													sympathetic white people.
												</p>
												<p>
													On December 1, 1955, they got another chance to make
													their case. That evening, 42-year-old
													<a
														href="https://www.biography.com/activist/rosa-parks"
														>Rosa Parks</a
													>
													boarded the Cleveland Avenue bus to go home after an
													exhausting day at work. She sat in the first row of
													the "colored" section in the middle of the bus. As the
													bus traveled its route, all the seats in the white
													section filled up, then several more white passengers
													boarded the bus.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													The bus driver noted that there were several white men
													standing and demanded that Parks and several other
													African Americans give up their seats. Three other
													African American passengers reluctantly gave up their
													places, but Parks remained seated.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													The driver asked her again to give up her seat and
													again she refused. Parks was arrested and booked for
													violating the Montgomery City Code. At her trial a
													week later, in a 30-minute hearing, Parks was found
													guilty and fined $10 and assessed $4 court fee.
												</p>
												<p>
													On the night that Parks was arrested,
													<a href="https://www.biography.com/activist/ed-nixon"
														>E.D. Nixon</a
													>, head of the local NAACP chapter met with King and
													other local civil rights leaders to plan a
													<a
														href="https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/montgomery-bus-boycott"
														rel="nofollow noopener"
														onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);"
														target="_blank"
														>Montgomery Bus Boycott</a
													>. King was elected to lead the boycott because he was
													young, well-trained with solid family connections and
													had professional standing. But he was also new to the
													community and had few enemies, so it was felt he would
													have strong credibility with the Black community.
												</p>
												<p>
													In his first speech as the group's president, King
													declared, "We have no alternative but to protest. For
													many years we have shown an amazing patience. We have
													sometimes given our white brothers the feeling that we
													liked the way we were being treated. But we come here
													tonight to be saved from that patience that makes us
													patient with anything less than freedom and justice."
												</p>
											</section>
											<section id="montogomery-bus-boycott">
												<p>
													King's skillful rhetoric put new energy into the civil
													rights struggle in Alabama. The bus boycott involved
													382 days of walking to work, harassment,
													violence,&nbsp;and intimidation for Montgomery's
													African American community. Both King's and Nixon's
													homes were attacked.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													But the African American community also took legal
													action against the city ordinance arguing that it was
													unconstitutional based on the
													<a
														href="https://www.history.com/topics/us-government/supreme-court-facts"
														rel="nofollow noopener"
														onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);"
														target="_blank"
														>Supreme Court's</a

													"separate is never equal" decision in

															rel="nofollow noopener"
															onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);"

															>Brown v. Board of Education</a
														></em
													>. After being defeated in several lower court rulings
													and suffering large financial losses, the city of
													Montgomery lifted the law mandating segregated public
													transportation.
												</p>

												<h2>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</h2>
												<p>
													Flush with victory, African American civil rights
													leaders recognized the need for a national
													organization to help coordinate their efforts. In
													January 1957, King,
													<a
														href="https://www.biography.com/activist/ralph-d-abernathy"
														>Ralph Abernathy</a
													>&nbsp;and 60 ministers and civil rights activists
													founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
													to harness the moral authority and organizing power of
													Black churches. They would help conduct non-violent
													protests to promote civil rights reform.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													King's participation in the organization gave him a
													base of operation throughout the South, as well as a
													national platform. The organization felt the best
													place to start to give African Americans a voice was
													to enfranchise them in the voting process. In February
													1958, the SCLC sponsored more than 20 mass meetings in
													key southern cities to register Black voters in the
													South. King met with religious and civil rights
													leaders and lectured all over the country on
													race-related issues.
												</p>
												<p>
													In 1959, with the help of the American Friends Service
													Committee, and inspired by
													<a
														href="https://www.biography.com/activist/mahatma-gandhi"
														>Mahatma Gandhi's</a
													>&nbsp;success with non-violent activism, King visited
													Gandhi's birthplace in India. The trip affected him in
													a profound way, increasing his commitment to America's
													civil rights struggle.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													African American civil rights activist
													<a
														href="https://www.biography.com/activist/bayard-rustin"
														>Bayard Rustin</a
													>, who had studied Gandhi's teachings, became one of
													King's associates and counseled him to dedicate
													himself to the principles of nonviolence. Rustin
													served as King's mentor and advisor throughout his
													early activism and was the main organizer of the 1963
													March on Washington.&nbsp;
												</p>

														>READ MORE: How Martin Luther King Jr. Took
														Inspiration From Gandhi Nonviolence</a
													>
												</p>
												<p>
													But Rustin was also a controversial figure at the
													time, being a homosexual with alleged ties to the
													Communist Party. Though his counsel was invaluable to
													King, many of his other supporters urged him to
													distance himself from Rustin.
												</p>

												<h2>Greensboro Sit-In</h2>
												<p>
													In February 1960, a group of African American students
													in&nbsp;North Carolina&nbsp;began what became known as
													the
													<a
														href="https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/the-greensboro-sit-in"
														rel="nofollow noopener"
														onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);"
														target="_blank"
														>Greensboro sit-in movement</a
													>.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													The students would sit at racially segregated lunch
													counters in the city's stores. When asked to leave or
													sit in the colored section, they just remained seated,
													subjecting themselves to verbal and sometimes physical
													abuse.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													The movement quickly gained traction in several other
													cities. In April 1960, the SCLC held a conference at
													Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina with local
													sit-in leaders. King encouraged students to continue
													to use nonviolent methods during their protests.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													Out of this meeting, the
													<a
														href="https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/sncc"
														rel="nofollow noopener"
														onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);"
														target="_blank"
														>Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee</a
													>
													formed and for a time, worked closely with the SCLC.
													By August of 1960, the sit-ins had been successful in
													ending segregation at lunch counters in 27 southern
													cities.
												</p>
												<p>
													By 1960, King was gaining national exposure. He
													returned to Atlanta to become co-pastor with his
													father at Ebenezer Baptist Church but also continued
													his civil rights efforts.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													On October 19, 1960, King and 75 students entered a
													local department store and requested lunch-counter
													service but were denied. When they refused to leave
													the counter area, King and 36 others were
													arrested.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													Realizing the incident would hurt the city's
													reputation, Atlanta's mayor negotiated a truce and
													charges were eventually dropped. But soon after, King
													was imprisoned for violating his probation on a
													traffic conviction.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													The news of his imprisonment entered the 1960
													presidential campaign when candidate
													<a
														href="https://www.biography.com/people/john-f-kennedy-9362930"
														>John F. Kennedy</a
													>
													made a phone call to Coretta Scott King. Kennedy
													expressed his concern for King's harsh treatment for
													the traffic ticket and political pressure was quickly
													set in motion. King was soon released.
												</p>

												<h2>Letter from Birmingham Jail</h2>
												<p>
													In the spring of 1963, King organized a demonstration
													in downtown Birmingham, Alabama. With entire families
													in attendance, city police turned dogs and fire hoses
													on demonstrators.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													King was jailed along with large numbers of his
													supporters, but the event drew nationwide attention.
													However, King was personally criticized by Black and
													white clergy alike for taking risks and endangering
													the children who attended the demonstration.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													In his famous
													<a
														href="https://www.history.com/news/kings-letter-from-birmingham-jail-50-years-later"
														rel="nofollow noopener"
														onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);"
														target="_blank"
														>Letter from Birmingham Jail</a
													>, King eloquently spelled out his theory of
													non-violence: "Nonviolent direct action seeks to
													create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a
													community, which has constantly refused to negotiate,
													is forced to confront the issue."
												</p>

												<h2>Inspiring Quotes by Martin Luther King Jr.</h2>
												<h2>'I Have a Dream' Speech</h2>
												<p>
													By the end of the Birmingham campaign, King and his
													supporters were making plans for a massive
													demonstration on the nation's capital composed of
													multiple organizations, all asking for peaceful
													change.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													On August 28, 1963, the historic
													<a

														rel="nofollow noopener"
														onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);"
														target="_blank"
														>March on Washington</a
													>
													drew more than 200,000 people in the shadow of the
													Lincoln Memorial. It was here that King made his
													famous "I Have a Dream" speech, emphasizing his belief
													that someday all men could be brothers
												</p>
												<blockquote>
													<p>
														<em
															>"I have a dream that my four children will one
															day live in a nation where they will not be judged
															by the color of their skin but by the content of
															their character."</em
														>
														&nbsp;— Martin Luther King, Jr. / "I Have A Dream"
														speech, August 28, 1963
													</p>
												</blockquote>
												<p>
													The rising tide of civil rights agitation produced a
													strong effect on public opinion. Many people in cities
													not experiencing racial tension began to question the
													nation's Jim Crow laws and the near-century of
													second-class treatment of African American
													citizens.&nbsp;

												<h2>Who Killed Martin Luther King Jr.?</h2>
												<p>
													By 1968, the years of demonstrations and
													confrontations were beginning to wear on King. He had
													grown tired of marches, going to jail, and living
													under the constant threat of death. He was becoming
													discouraged at the slow progress of civil rights in
													America and the increasing criticism from other
													African American leaders.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													Plans were in the works for another march on
													Washington to revive his movement and bring attention
													to a widening range of issues. In the spring of 1968,
													a labor strike by Memphis sanitation workers drew King
													to one last crusade.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													On April 3, he gave his final and what proved to be an
													eerily prophetic speech,&nbsp;“I’ve Been to the
													Mountaintop,”&nbsp;in which he told supporters at the
													Mason Temple in Memphis, "I've seen the promised land.
													I may not get there with you. But I want you to know
													tonight that we, as a people, will get to the promised
													land."&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													The next day, while standing on a balcony outside his
													room at the Lorraine Motel, Martin Luther King Jr. was
													killed by a sniper's bullet. The shooter, a malcontent
													drifter and former convict named
													<a
														href="https://www.biography.com/crime-figure/james-earl-ray"
														>James Earl Ray</a
													>, was eventually apprehended after a two-month,
													international manhunt.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													The assassination sparked riots and demonstrations in
													more than 100 cities across the country. In 1969, Ray
													pleaded guilty to assassinating King and was sentenced
													to 99 years in prison. He died in prison on April 23,
													1998.
												</p>

												<h2>Legacy</h2>
												<p>
													King's life had a seismic impact on race relations in
													the United States. Years after his death, he is the
													most widely known African American leader of his
													era.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													His life and work have been honored with a national
													holiday, schools and public buildings named after him,
													and a memorial on Independence Mall in Washington,
													D.C.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													But his life remains controversial as well. In the
													1970s,
													<a

														rel="nofollow noopener"
														onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);"

														rel="nofollow noopener"
														onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);"
														target="_blank"
														>Freedom of Information Act</a
													>, revealed that he was under government surveillance,
													and suggested his involvement in adulterous
													relationships and communist influences.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													Over the years, extensive archival studies have led to
													a more balanced and comprehensive assessment of his
													life, portraying him as a complex figure: flawed,
													fallible and limited in his control over the mass
													movements with which he was associated, yet a
													visionary leader who was deeply committed to achieving
													social justice through nonviolent means.
												</p>

												<h2>Martin Luther King Jr. Day</h2>
												<p>
													In 1983,
													<a
														href="https://www.biography.com/us-president/ronald-reagan"
														>President Ronald Reagan</a
													>
													signed into law a bill creating Martin Luther King Jr.
													Day, a federal holiday honoring the legacy of the
													slain civil rights leader.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>
													Martin Luther King Jr. Day was first celebrated in
													1986, and in all 50 states in 2000.
